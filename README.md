# circle-blvd-android

An Android client for Circle Blvd, project management for small teams.

### developer setup

This app is built on top of the Ionic Framework. You'll want to at least install 
[Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/).

As this is only a client to access Circle Blvd servers, and not a Circle Blvd
server itself, you'll need to install and run a Circle Blvd server as well.

Quickest setup:
 * Install CouchDB and Node.js
 * Install the [Circle Blvd](http://github.com/holmwell/circle-blvd) server
 * Install Ionic (and Cordova)
 * Run the circle-blvd server
 * Run this client via 'cd app' and 'ionic serve --lc'

If you want to deploy, you'll need the Android SDK.
